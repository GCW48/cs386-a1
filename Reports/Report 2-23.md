I did not work on anything this week.

Worked on making chairs, tables, doors, stools for the game

Maya: 

Worked on Weekly Worksheets

Thought through specifics of storyline, and possible variety of enemy and character designs.


# Retrospection:


Appreciation: 

Gordon made cool models for chairs, tables, and doors that we can use in game prototype.

Successes:

Some new designs were created

Failures:

No specific storyline is created yet

I (Carson) failed to make any progress on the programing side of the project since which is a problem for deliverable 3. 

Barriers:

Upcoming tests and midterms. 

Next Time: 

Make more progress on story so we can texture assets and create character so we have a game to test . 

# Next steps 


Carson: 

Finish character. 

Gordon:

Put bones in characters

Maya:

Continue cleaning up enemy/character designs, taking into consideration the them of the story and overall vibe.

Start drafting script/dialogue for the game. (storyboarding)
