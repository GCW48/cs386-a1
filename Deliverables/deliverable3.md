# System Description


The problem of Isolation among students is prevalent, therefore our **game** aims to create a
horror environment that mirrors these sentiments in order to create a relatable experience that
encapsulates these feelings in a controlled manner. Our goal is to use unsettling art, stealth mechanics, and story to replicate feelings of social confusion. Particularly, this title will aim to allow students to gain a new perspective on their social environment.




Our key system requirements are **movement**, **stealth**, **art**, and **story**.




The **movement system** should be smooth, but have enough uncertainty to
be adequate for a horror title. Our _core mechanic requirements_ are _walking, running, and jumping_. It should be smooth, but somewhat slow, so the player can enjoy the game while still adding to the horror theme.




The **stealth system** should have reasonable **enemy** ***pathfinding*** and clean _timing_ for the **disguise mask mechanic**. If the player is ***caught by an enemy***, they should be ***sent back to the start***. The **player** can ***put on a mask to avoid detection*** by the **enemies**, but they cannot keep it on too long or else they will be ***sent back to the start***. This system should be well-balanced in regards to _timing_. A _timer_ too short would be frustrating to the player, while a _timer_ too long would lack any meaning.




The **art** of the title should properly ***convey a sense of dread to the player***. The artstyle is focused around a _college_ campus. The _protagonist's appearance_ is meant to be ambiguous as to allow the  player to relate to the characters. The _monster designs_ loom over the player to invoke dread.




The **story** is intended to show the protagonist becoming more comfortable with their _horror scenario_ within the school. It follows the _isolated protagonist_ as they attend a new school. They soon see their peers' faces get taken and run away, only to have theirs taken too. They must journey further into the school to regain their face, all the while, ***becoming more comfortable navigating the school.***
