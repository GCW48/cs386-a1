# Deliverable 1

## Project:
In this 3D horror game created with Godot, you play as a college student trying to escape a nightmarish version of your campus. Your face is brutally peeled off 

by the sinister being. As you navigate the eerie environment, you must solve puzzles and avoid terrifying creatures to keep your identity intact. Your ultimate

goal is to escape before your identity is lost forever, but time is running out.

Our game allows college students who enjoy horror games, and are short on time, to play something short and relatable by creating a short

game about identity in a college atmosphere.

customer segment:

They are a college student who studies pre-med, and eventually nursing. 

insights:

They found themselves still prioritizing games even in college, so they did not have much of 

an opinion on shorter titles and changes in how they intreact wiht the medium. However, they do have quiet a bit of expierence with horror. 

They gave the advice that they find timed mechanics in horror games to be effective in moderation.

If we make the platforming too hard, timing too tight, and controls too loose; then the entire expierence will be frustrating.
 
quotes:

"If you want to make a platformer, then don't make your controls too loose" (paraphrased).

Overall:

It was nice to talk with someone with a bit of expierence. I think the big takeaway is balancing platforming and percision gameplay with horror.

Although they are not inverse, lack of control is a key of horror, so we should make a decision on which we would like to lean into more.
