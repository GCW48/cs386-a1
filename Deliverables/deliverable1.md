# Deliverable 1

## Project:
In this 3D horror game created with Godot, you play as a college student trying to escape a nightmarish version of your campus. Your face is brutally peeled off 

by the sinister being. As you navigate the eerie environment, you must solve puzzles and avoid terrifying creatures to keep your identity intact. Your ultimate

goal is to escape before your identity is lost forever, but time is running out.

## Value Proposition:

Our game allows college students who enjoy horror games, and are short on time, to play something short and relatable by creating a short

game about identity in a college atmosphere.
